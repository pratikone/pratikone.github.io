  Namaskar ! I am Pratik Anand - I work as a software engineer in the industry. These days I am very interested in modern C++ language, graphics technologies like UI framework and game engines and webassembly. 
</p>

In my free time, I contribute to [RigelEngine](https://github.com/lethal-guitar/RigelEngine) an open source modern C++ based game engine to run Duke Nukem II with modern enhancements like running it on a web browser, adding widescreen mode and game controller support.

I also like to draw 2D and 3D art. Here are some of my art for showcase.
